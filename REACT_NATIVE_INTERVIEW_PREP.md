## 🔍 **Interview Questions & Answers**

### **Q1: "How did you handle state management?"**

**Answer:**
"I implemented Redux Toolkit for centralized state management with custom middleware for different business domains. Each domain (Remittance, Currency, User) has its own slice, selector, and middleware, ensuring clean separation of concerns and predictable state updates."

### **Q2: "Tell me about your component architecture"**

**Answer:**
"I created a sophisticated component system with CommonFormComponents that handles multiple input types through a single interface. This reduces code duplication by 70% across the application while maintaining consistency and making maintenance easier."

### **Q3: "How did you handle navigation?"**

**Answer:**
"I implemented a custom drawer navigation with stack navigation for different user flows. The navigation is role-based and handles deep linking for different financial services, providing a seamless user experience."

### **Q4: "What about performance optimization?"**

**Answer:**
"I implemented lazy loading for components, optimized re-renders with proper state management, and used React.memo where appropriate. The app also includes efficient list rendering and optimized API calls."

### **Q5: "How did you handle security?"**

**Answer:**
"I implemented secure data handling with account number masking, secure API communication using custom hooks, token management, and proper validation for financial transactions."
