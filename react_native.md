## ðŸ“˜ React Native Interview Q&A (3 to 6 Years Experience)

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner React Native Questions

### 1. **What is React Native and how is it different from React?**

**Answer:**

- **React** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces on the web, rendering to HTML elements in the browser.
- **React Native** is a framework for building native mobile applications using React, rendering to native UI components (View, Text, Image) on iOS and Android.
- **Key Differences:**
  - React renders to DOM, React Native renders to native components
  - React Native has platform-specific APIs and components
  - Styling in React Native uses StyleSheet instead of CSS
  - React Native apps can access device features (camera, GPS, etc.)

---

### 2. **What are components in React Native?**

**Answer:**
Components are reusable pieces of UI that can be composed together. In React Native:

- **Functional Components:** Use hooks and return JSX
- **Class Components:** Use lifecycle methods and render method
- **Built-in Components:** View, Text, Image, ScrollView, etc.
- **Custom Components:** User-defined components for specific functionality

---

### 3. **What is the difference between View, Text, and Image in React Native?**

**Answer:**

- **View:** A container component (similar to div in HTML) - used for layout and grouping other components
- **Text:** Displays text content - only component that can contain text directly
- **Image:** Displays images from local assets or network URLs - supports various resize modes and caching

---

### 4. **How do you apply styling in React Native?**

**Answer:**

- Use **StyleSheet.create()** for better performance and validation
- Apply styles via the `style` prop
- Styles are JavaScript objects with camelCase properties
- No CSS - all styling is done through JavaScript objects
- Support for flexbox, positioning, colors, typography, etc.

---

### 5. **What is the use of StyleSheet.create()?**

**Answer:**

- **Performance:** Optimizes style objects for better rendering performance
- **Validation:** Provides runtime validation of style properties
- **Code organization:** Groups related styles together
- **Reusability:** Allows styles to be shared between components

---

### 6. **What are props and state in React Native?**

**Answer:**

- **Props:** Immutable data passed from parent to child components (read-only)
- **State:** Mutable data managed within a component that triggers re-renders when changed
- **Props** are used for configuration and data flow
- **State** is used for component-specific data that changes over time

---

### 7. **What are the lifecycle methods of a class component?**

**Answer:**

- **Mounting:** `constructor()`, `render()`, `componentDidMount()`
- **Updating:** `render()`, `componentDidUpdate()`
- **Unmounting:** `componentWillUnmount()`
- **Error Handling:** `componentDidCatch()`
- **Note:** Modern React Native development prefers functional components with hooks

---

### 8. **How do you handle button presses or touch events?**

**Answer:**

- Use **TouchableOpacity**, **TouchableHighlight**, or **Pressable** components
- Handle events with `onPress`, `onLongPress`, `onPressIn`, `onPressOut`
- For custom touch handling, use **PanGestureHandler** or **GestureResponder**
- Example: `<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => handlePress()}>`

---

### 9. **How do you navigate between screens in React Native?**

**Answer:**

- Use **React Navigation** library (most popular)

- Navigate using `navigation.navigate('ScreenName')`
- Pass parameters: `navigation.navigate('Screen', { param: value })`
- Handle back navigation and screen lifecycle

---

### 10. **How to handle forms and text inputs in React Native?**

**Answer:**

- Use **TextInput** component for text entry

- **setState:** Method for class components, can accept function or object
- **useState** is more predictable and easier to use
- **setState** can batch updates and accepts callback functions

---

### 15. **What are controlled vs uncontrolled components?**

**Answer:**

- **Controlled:** Component state is managed by React (useState), input value is tied to state
- **Uncontrolled:** Component manages its own internal state, values accessed via refs
- **Controlled** is preferred in React Native for better state management and validation
- **Uncontrolled** is less common but can be useful for simple forms

---

### 16. **Explain useEffect and its cleanup behavior**

**Answer:**

- **useEffect** runs side effects in functional components
- **Cleanup function** runs before component unmounts or before next effect runs
- Useful for subscriptions, timers, and event listeners

- Example: `useEffect(() => { /* effect */ return () => { /* cleanup */ } }, [deps])`

---

### 17. **How do you use async/await with useEffect?**

**Answer:**

- Create async function inside useEffect
- Call the async function immediately
- Handle errors with try-catch blocks
- Use cleanup to cancel ongoing operations
- Be careful with dependency arrays to prevent infinite loops

---

### 18. **What is the difference between React Navigation and React Native Navigation?**

**Answer:**
